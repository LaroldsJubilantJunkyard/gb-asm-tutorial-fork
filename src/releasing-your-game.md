# Releasing your Game

Once you've finished your game, be proud of yourself and share it with others. The easiest ways to share it online with others are via [itch.io](https://itch.io) or the gbdev's ["homebrew hub"](https://hh.gbdev.io/).

The Game Boy is a retro handheld, maybe sharing it online doesn't fully satisfy you. How about a physical release then? A number of developers have released physical versions of their games:

For that, you have two paths:

 * You can release it on your own
 * You can connect with a publisher
## Part A: Self-Publishing your game

### Physical Cartridges

If you're trying to save money, many people were able to just buy repro carts on sites like aliexpress.com.

> **Note:** These are not always the best quality cartridges. In addition, it might be difficult making sure the cartridge is the type/size your game needs.

There are a number of people online who make good quality cartridges:

- [Inside Gadgets](https://shop.insidegadgets.com/)
- [Ferrante Crafts](https://shop.insidegadgets.com/product/gbxcart-rw/)
- TODO list of cartridge makers

>**Note:** Inside Gadgets, has a guide on ["Choosing a flash cart"](https://shop.insidegadgets.com/choosing-a-flash-cart/). Be sure to read it to help determine what you need.

### Required Hardware

In order to write the data to your cartridge you'll need to a basic device such as the Inside Gadgets' [GBxCart RW](https://shop.insidegadgets.com/product/gbxcart-rw/).
